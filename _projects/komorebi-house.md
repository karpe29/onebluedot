This weekend home is a harmonious retreat that celebrates the ethereal beauty of komorebiâ€”the Japanese term for the interplay of sunlight filtering through treesâ€”and the grounding essence of soil. Nestled in a serene, natural setting, the design integrates natural elements and a deep connection to the land, creating a tranquil haven for relaxation and reflection.
