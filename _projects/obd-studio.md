Inserted between a row of modern compact stand alone houses on what was once a ordinary Residential Villa, the OBD studio an immediate reading at first sight. Upon approach, the use of  neutral palette and reconfigured minimal art curation grabs attention making it a cozy abode for creative interaction. The studio embodies the minimalist approach, which emphasises clean lines and fundamental features but also tropical modernist eye for locally sourced materials to minimize environmental impact and connect with regional culture. Natural materials like wood and stone are used to blend in with the environment and provide thermal insulation
